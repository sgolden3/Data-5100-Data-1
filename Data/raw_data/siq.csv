Health and morphology of kelp field:  appears very healthy, clean, whole, uniform color given two distinct morphs, and scant surface deposits. Plants with bulbs ≥2.5 in diameter are a darker color, purple-brown, compared to plants with bulbs ≤ 2.0 in diamter which are a lighter color, amber. Stipes are consistently the same color as bulbs for a given plant . Samples were collected from 40 different plants for molecular ecology analysis.
C. Density of kelp field and orientation in water column: The end point areas are low density often with only 1-2 plants between inner and outer borders. The center of the crescent shape field is the most dense and the widest (at northeast and north side of island). In the low density area closest to the start point most plants had upper end of stipes oriented vertically in water and blades completely floating near or at surface roughly parallel. This contrasted with the high density zones where plants had long sections of stipes floating at the surface and most blades invisible or under the surface. Most of the surface area of this high density center area was completely covered with kelp. Any future density measurements should not count only bulbs, but rather stipes in most locations and bulbs in other locations as long as individual plants can be distinguished.
D. Human impacts: one banana peel1ft from kelp field on north side; signs on island,“Keep Off”;  buoys ~50 yd off shore prevent boats from getting close; shore and intertidal areas appear undisturbed; ~0.5 in-thick cream colored, finely crushed shell material lays undisturbed in sandy areas between rocks.
E. Other kelp species: Ulva latica (ubiquitous, mid-low intertidal); Fucus distichus (plentiful, mostly mid, some patches low); Sargassum muticum (2-5 ftL, just below surface, at inner border); Saccharina latissima, (ubiquitous, near/above & below waterline, very large blades); Costaria Costata (2.75ft L, south side); Unknown brown seaweed (NE side, dry, blade like Alaria marginata but stipe like Saccharina setchellii); possibly ≥1 more brown seaweed present; Hildenbrandia sp (noticeable at east side); only one red seaweed found, turkish towel, but it was a detached piece; possibly ≥1 more red seaweed present.
F. Fish:  (1)3-in fish observed in spaces of kelp on east side (possibly salmon or stickleback); (3)shiner perch seen same location previous week during recon visit; (1) small fish jumped from water on east side (probably 6-in L or less).","G. Birds: (1)pigeon guillemot diving for fish 20yd from start point/south side upon my arrival within 20 yd of kelp field, it flew off to SW after 3 seconds; (2) blue heron, large and small, in flight, appeared to prepare to land on the island; many bird vocalizations heard on the east, northeast, and north side of island.  

H. Eel Grass: No eel grass observed within bull kelp field; eel grass growing in sparse clumps ~6-10 ft from start point and ~50 ft from turnaround point; massive, thick eel grass beds growing on south and west sides of island covered with wooly, brown detritus/algae, but leaves are green underneath.

I. Intertidal and sub tidal organisms: 
•	large Dungeness crab (in kelp below surface, southeast side);
•	Nucella, sp. (ubiquitous, mid-low intertidal zone, 1-2 in L); 
•	Sabellidae sp (1 colony, ~15 parchment tubes 6-12 in L, NE side, dry, at inner border); 
•	Evasterias sp, (gray, radius = 7in, healthy, on vertical rock wall just above water line, north side); 
•	Pisaster ochraceus, (purple, radius = 9 in, healthy, feeding, partially above water line, north side); 
•	Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, (green, diameter = 2 in, vertical rock wall just above water line, north side);
•	limpets, (few, occasional, north side)
•	Katharina tunicata, (near water line, northeast side)
•	Unknown (floating at waterline near start point; no visible tentacles; milky to transparent with purple geometrically place lines spiraling from poles, turgid, smooth surface, buoyant yet dense, very thin membrane, interior appears to be a liquid, 2.5-3 inch L, see diagram)

B. Density of kelp field and orientation in water column: Most of the surface area of the highest density center area was completely covered with bull kelp. Field overall looks same as before. Often large sections of the stipes and bulbs are floating on surface and blades generally below the surface. 90% or more of the inner border of kelp field is at the waterline and in a few areas bull kelp plants are laying down on the rocky beach.
C. Human impacts: Same tribal fishing boat is anchored ~35 yards from kelp bed starting point and two buoys are fixed ~30-50 yd off shore at southeast end of island. Much boating activity and resulting waves.
D. Other kelp species: Three kelp species discovered today not previously reported: Mastocarpus sp. (Turkish washcloth); Mazzaella splendens (iridescent seaweed); Coralline Red Encrusting Seaweed (pink color).

As last time many bulbs have a green algae growing on them, but now the green algae extends several feet along the stipes. As last time, some bulbs have tissue
that appears either damaged, bleached, or dead, lacking normal green color.
B. Density of kelp field and orientation in water column: For the most part there is space between the inner border and the rocky shore for paddling: largest
areas are on northeast, east and south sides of island. Some sections of northwest inner border kelp are at waterline; paddling the inner border cannot be done
accurately or safely even at +3ft. Large sections of the stipes are floating on surface and blades are underwater, hanging downward or unfurled to the east. The
bulbs appear to be a few inches higher above the surface than usual.
C. Water: near bull kelp field the water is very turbid and there is foam and slime on the surface.
D. Human impacts: much large boat traffic creating waves; people retrieving crab pots nearby; large tribal fishing boat usually anchored here is gone; ~50 yards
from kelp bed off SE corner are two new red buoys with flags and blue tour boat, Island Whaler (photo) motored past very close to these buoys.
E. Birds, fish, mammals: Gulls in bull kelp field. Several small fish were seen jumping from surface. Harbor seal ~70yd off NE end of kelp field marked. Pigeon
guillemot flew across water from south end of island.
F. Intertidal and sub tidal organisms: many large and small egg yolk jellies near the surface.","At the northwest section of the outer border GPS track, large waves caused me to paddle away from the perimeter. When the waves
subsided 2-3 minutes later I returned to the perimeter; these extra points are in the log and indicated on the BaseCamp map. After completion of the perimeter
track I took the temp and depth measurements from the point furthest from shore. *Next, I quickly re-paddled the kelp field and took all the photos. Most of the
way there was room for my kayak to track the inner border, but there still are problems on the north side even at+3 ft tide level. Possibly there would be more
room to paddle the inner border at +4 to +5ft.

border at SE end come right up to waterline; blades were mostly below the surface; bulbs often at surface; stipes often at surface.
C. Human impacts: None observed; one person was digging near waterline for 1hr near center of inner border of kelp field; 2 high powered boats every 5 min
creates continual cycles of wave action at shore.

E. Fish: (3) fish jumped from water, size ranging from 6-12in L.
F. Eel Grass: Dense areas of eel grass are growing all along the inner border of the bull kelp. There is a red-brown ‘algae-like’ growth covering the eel grass
giving it a ruffled or rouched appearance.

I think it is best to leave the Cornet Bay boat launch area 30-40 minutes before slack current, allowing more
time at the kelp bed and more time to return before the current gets too strong. According to the NOAA tables the current was 1.8 to 2 knots when I was about to
round the point and enter Cornet Bay: the water was like high energy jelly, requiring strenuous paddling if 10-12yd offshore. Progress forward could only be
made by paddling in shallow water ~2 yd from shore, but if a power boat was coming through then keeping 10-12 yd offshore at times seemed necessary. Be
warned that when the Victoria Clipper comes by it can generate waves 2.5 - 4ft high that break on shore. You do not want to be near the kelp field inner border,
but rather on the beach or much further out in the water.
There is a huge difference in the area between high and low tide: possibly twice the size at -1ft compared to +6ft. Roughly speaking, last night at
+6ft tide there was approximately a 100,000sqft area where the kelp was invisible/separated by much >8M, but today at low tide it is included in the data. In
other words last night the measurable kelp field was the section starting a little ways SE of Waypoint 500, but today the measureable area also includes the
section located above Waypoint 500 stretching as far NW as Waypoint 498.

pots; power boats visited some of these floats. The Victoria Clipper appeared at 5:59pm but I was far enough south of
the shoal/most prominent shore section jutting out into water, that the waves did not disturb my tracking too much.

the spit. I started paddling at 5:25pm and arrived at the southeast end of the kelp bed 30 minutes later; I did a lot of power paddling trying to get there as soon
as possible. I stayed 50-100 yd from shore where I felt sheltered from the ~9mph wind. On the return trip I did less power paddling and it took me 45 minutes.

that the plant is there just below the surface.

spit. “Wave wall” seen in June was not present. I landed ~100 yd from my car and on this side of the spit the tidal zone is sandy. The driftwood in front of the
car was tricky but manageable (NE corner of parking lot). After loading the car, I left the area at 11:00am. I chose Ala Spit to launch from thinking it would be to
my advantage, but it wasn’t (too much time to launch, too much carrying the kayak too far, and dangerous mud in the lagoon area). Well, at least I didn’t

Bed density is lower than previous years in a zone along the outer margin, with scattered bulb or small bulb clusters (see gray oval Figure 1, approximating low density area). It was not possible to effectively trace a clear margin, so included that low density region within the track. Southeastern end of bed which connects to remaining beds that extend to Keystone is much lower density than in past couple of years. There was a small cluster of bulbs northwest of bed, but did not track or mark (see Figure 1).

Most dramatic change is the reduction in the northwest end of the bed - the largest reduction in 10 years of monitoring.
